### Started by Sarah Aguasvivas (January 2019)

These codes are intended to be used by a microcontroller programmmed in C after the neural network has been trained in a package such as Keras or Tensorflow and the parameters are saved. This enables the microcontroller to be used online. It is compatible with any freeRTOS code, the ESP32 and Arduino systems.
