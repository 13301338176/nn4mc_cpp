Welcome to NN4MC
================

`nn4mc` is a C++ library that allows the user to take as input trained neural network model files and compile C code that executes the neural network model for online neural network predictions.

nn4mc is a work in progress - input is welcome. Available documentation is limited for now.
`Examples <https://github.com/correlllab/nn4mc/tree/master/examples>`_ are available in `.cpp` format.
